<h2>Advantages and disadvantages of burning hydrogen for low carbon heating</h2>

<p>There is a lot of talk about the merits of<a href="Advantages_Burning_Hydrogen_Heating.html">burning hydrogen for heating</a>. This has some some merits for low carbon heating, 
but there are some significant costs, safety issues and serious health issues.</p>   

<!--- <li><a href="Smart_Hubs.html"                                       >Local Smart Grids</a></li>    --->

<h2>Getting serious about Net Zero</h2>
<p>We need to be<a href="Getting_Serious_about_Net_Zero.html">getting serious about net zero</a> and limiting our carbon emissions. 
The route to lower carbon emissions is to stop burning fuels for heating and transport: there are alternatives.</p>

<!---
<h2>Smart Local Energy Systems</h2>
<p><a href="Smart_Hubs.html">Local Smart Grids</a> can save carbon emissions by coordinating the local generation, storage and use of electricity. 
They can also save carbon by coordinating the local generation, storage and use of heat, and the storage and delivery of elecricity for transport.</p>
--->

<h2>Fifth Generation District Heating Networks</h2>
<p>New <a href="Fifth_Generation_District_Heating_Networks.html">fifth generation district heating networks</a> avoid heat losses 
to the ground by circulating water to buildings at near ground temperture &#8211; 
this allows heat pumps in each building to extract heat, if they need heating, or reject heat, if they need cooling.  
Buildings which need heat benefit from those which reject heat to the heat sharing network and vice versa.</p>

<h2>Advantages of District Heating</h2>
<p>There is an alternative form of district heating which neatly resolves all the limitations of CHP based district heat networks: 
<a href="Advantages_District_Heating.html">district heating based on heat pumps</a>.

<h2>Decarbonising Cooling</h2>
<p>Up to 10% of UK electricity is used to provide air conditioning and cooling. 
The mechanism of using roof mounted chillers to waste heat to the atmosphere is very inefficient. 
There is a much better route to <a href="Decarbonising_Cooling.html">decarbonise cooling.</a></p>

<h2>Decarbonising Heating</h2>
<p>The grid is decarbonising each year. The electrification of heat is advancing. 
Do you know the best route to <a href="Decarbonising_Heating_2022.html">decarbonising heating?</a></p>

<h2>Decarbonising the Grid</h2>
<p>In order to meet international obligations the government is arranging for the decarbonisation of electricity generation for the national grid. 
This <a href="Decarbonising_the_Grid.html">decarbonising of the grid</a> is encouraging the electrification of heat.</p>

<h2>Interseasonal Heat Storage</h2>
<p>The key to balancing supply and demand on the grid is to be found in electricity storage 
and <a href="Interseasonal_Heat_Storage.html">Interseasonal Heat Storage</a>. </p>

<h2>Internet of Things</h2>
<p>Connecting heat pumps to the National Grid via the Internet of Things enables Demand Side Response, load balancing and saving costs:
<a href="Internet_of_Things_Heat_Pumps.html" >Internet of Things &#8211; heat pump controls</a>.

<h2>Integrating Renewable Technologies to recycle heat from summer to winter</h2>
<p>Renewable energy technologies can be combined in order to balance the merits of solar thermal collectors 
with ground source energy using the critical link of Seasonal Thermal Storage. 
The whole is greater than the sum of the parts. 
See <a href="integrating_renewable_technologies.html"> Integrating Renewable Technologies</a> to recycle heat and achieve energy efficiency in buildings.</p>

<h2>Energy Trilemma</h2>
<p>Policy makers are concerned about the Energy Trilemma: they need to resolve the needs for 
<ul>
<li>high security of supply</li>
<li>low carbon emissions</li>
<li>and low cost of energy.</li>
 </ul>
There is a solution to the <a href="Energy_Trilemma.html">Energy Trilemma</a>.</p>

<h2>Air Quality</h2>
<p>All but two of London’s boroughs are exceeding EU limits for Nitrogen Dioxide, a toxic gas linked to respiratory problems.
<a href="Urban_Air_Quality.html">Air Quality</a> is becoming an increasing concern in urban planning. There is a solution for reducing air pollution.</p>

<h2>Electrification of Heat</h2>
<p>In order to reduce carbon emissions from heating we need to find alternatives to combustion. 
This implies the <a href="Electrification_of_Heat.html">Electrification of Heat</a> which in turn means using heat pumps for heat transfer and the ground for thermal energy storage.</p>

<h2>Heat Pumps in District Heating</h2>
<p> Heat Pumps in District Heating, published by DECC in February 2016, recognises the value of using heat pumps in District Heating to lower carbon emissions 
in place of central gas boilers or gas based CHP: <a href="Heat_Pumps_District_Heating.html">Heat Pumps in District Heating</a>.</p>


<h2>Demand Side Response</h2>
<p>Businesses can save money if they are prepared to be flexible in the timing of their demand for electricity: 
<a href="Demand_Side_Response.html">Demand Response</a>.</p>

<h2>CP1 Heat Networks: a Code of Practice</h2>
<p>In response to DECC's desire to see an increase in the use of heat networks in order to reduce carbon emissions and reliance on imported fossil fuels, 
CIBSE has produced a <a href="CP1_Heat_Networks.html">Heat Networks: Code of Practice</a> to encourage high standards. What are the implications?</p>                                

<h2>CP2 Surface Water Source Heat Pumps: a Code of Practice</h2>
<p>In response to DECC's desire to see an increase in the transfer of heat from open water to reduce carbon emissions, CIBSE has produced 
 a <a href="CP2_Surface_Water_Source_Heat_Pumps.html" >Surface Water Source Heat Pumps: Code of Practice</a> to encourage a high standard of installations.</p>

<h2>The BBC discovers heat pumps</h2>
<p>The BBC discovers that heat pumps can be used to transfer heat from the Irish Sea into a National Trust property in Anglesey 
and save &#163;40,000 of running costs each year as well as being kinder to the environment: 
<a href="BBC_discovers_Heat_Pumps.html">BBC discovers heat pumps</a>.</p>

<h2>Sir David Attenborough meets President Obama</h2>
<p>Sir David Attenborough meets President Obama in the White House: The President asks Attenborough if there is any hope that man can arrest climate change: 
<a href="Attenborough_meets_Obama.html">Attenborough meets Obama.</a>


<h2>The Internet of Heat</h2>
<p><a href="Internet_of_Heat.html">Internet of Heat</a> combines communication and control technologies with heat transfer to reduce carbon emissions from heating by recycling heat. 
This also contributes to reducing air pollution.</p>

<!---
<h2>Unparalleled performance efficiency</h2>
<p>In response to an article on ground source heat pump installation issues 
in the August 2014 edition of the CIBSE Journal <i>"What lies beneath?"</i>, Andy Ford says
